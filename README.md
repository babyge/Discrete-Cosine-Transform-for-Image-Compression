# Discrete-Cosine-Transform-for-Image-Compression

Matlab image compression algorithm using the discrete cosine transform. The original image is transformed into an 8 by 8 block and then using the inverse transform the image is reconstructed. Inverse DCT was performed using a subset of DCT coefficients.The error image (difference between the original and reconstructed images) is also calculated.
